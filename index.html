		<span class = "position">Personal Project<span class = "times">Winter 2014</span></span><br>
		<p class = "descript">Worked on this game over winter break 2014, made with JavaScript and HTML5. This was supposed to be a smaller project that I could reasonably complete, so that I could show a finished product using my skills. It was helpful in teaching me to pay attention to details such as how blocks should interact once a smaller ring is cleared and a larger one must take its place. I also got to hear some feedback from the friends who tried the game, and I learned of a better scoring system and that my game over state was not communicated clearly enough. It was also my first time working with the canvas methods, so I just stuck to learning to draw squares, and I tried to emulate a Tetris style of animation on the blocks falling. However, I feel that the way the game handles blocks missing the center could have been designed better or if there was no better solution than sliding them, I should have made that more clear.</p>

		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<span class = "position">Cell Signaling Technology - Paid Intern <span class = "times">Summer 2015</span></span><br>
		<p class = "descript">Worked on webapp for internal usage, using Backbone.js, D3.js, and Ruby on Rails. Helped fix bugs, implement a favoriting system that would show users and the items they favorited and store it all in a seperate table on the MYSQL database, and made a modified version of <a href = "http://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/publications/upset-visualization-intersecting-sets">UpSet</a> for visualising the intersection of set queries. Learned about CSRF, and used caching as well as prerendered JSON strings in the database to speed up data load times around 4x. Used bit arrays containing whether an item was in or was not in a set to save space in localStorage when transferring query data to UpSet, which was a separate tab from our dataset loader.</p>
